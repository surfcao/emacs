;; Load appropriate files in this directory
(init-loader-load "~/.emacs.d/init.d")
;;
;; Note that not all files in the directory are loaded.  Each file is
;; examined that if it is a .el or .elc file and, it has a valid name
;; specified by `init-loader-default-regexp' or it is a platform
;; specific configuration file.
;;
;; By default, valid names of configuration files start with two
;; digits.  For example, the following file names are all valid:
;;     00_util.el
;;     01_ik-cmd.el
;;     21_javascript.el
;;     99_global-keys.el
;;
;; Files are loaded in the lexicographical order.  This helps you to
;; resolve dependency of the configurations.
;;
;; A platform specific configuration file has a prefix corresponds to
;; the platform.  The following is the list of prefixes and platform
;; specific configuration files are loaded in the listed order after
;; non-platform specific configuration files.
;;
;; Platform   Subplatform        Prefix         Example
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Windows                       windows-       windows-fonts.el
;;            Meadow             meadow-        meadow-commands.el
;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Mac OS X   Carbon Emacs       carbon-emacs-  carbon-emacs-applescript.el
;;            Cocoa Emacs        cocoa-emacs-   cocoa-emacs-plist.el

;;
;; If `init-loader-byte-compile' is non-nil, each configuration file
;; is byte-compiled when it is loaded.  If you modify the .el file,
;; then it is recompiled next time it is loaded.
;;
;; Loaded files and errors during the loading process are recorded.
;; If `init-loader-show-log-after-init' is non-nil, the record is
;; shown after the overall loading process.  You can do this manually
;; by M-x init-loader-show-log.
